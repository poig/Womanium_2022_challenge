- [ ] [Green Qupermarket - Technical Focus (Deloitte)](https://github.com/womanium-quantum/Green-Qupermarket-Technical-Focus---Deloitte)ready to startï¼Œ[repository](https://github.com/poig/womanium-Green-Qupermarket---Technical-Focus-Deloitte-)
- [ ] [Quantum Natural Language Processing with lambeq (Quantinuum)](https://github.com/womanium-quantum/Quantum-Natural-Language-Processing-with-lambeq---Quantinuum)need to write a report. finish first overview, can proceed going deeper in custom ansatz for better accuracy, try different reader and better rewriting. Or write a report about it.
- [ ] [Digital-analog Variational Quantum Eigensolver (IQM)](https://github.com/iqm-finland/iqm-academy-womanium-hackathon-DAQC-VQE)complete task to get full score.

extra for learning perpose(by order):
- [ ] [World-class-Quantum-chemistry-with-TKET---Quantinuum](https://github.com/womanium-quantum/World-class-Quantum-chemistry-with-TKET---Quantinuum) take ibm quantum challenge and QPARC as a reference for further research for a best ansatz to optimize the ground state.
- [ ] [Random-number-generation-using-boson-sampling---ORCA-Computing](https://github.com/womanium-quantum/Random-number-generation-using-boson-sampling---ORCA-Computing) still to be determine path to research. nice related [boardcast](https://sectigo.com/resource-library/root-causes-1-57-quantum-random-number-generation)
- [ ] [Predict-the-orbit-of-the-James-Webb-space-telescope-with-a-quantum-algorithm---Herman-Kolden](https://github.com/womanium-quantum/Predict-the-orbit-of-the-James-Webb-space-telescope-with-a-quantum-algorithm---Herman-Kolden)  may be can looking back to pennylane coding challenge and qiskit-network reference for further exploring.
- [ ] [Quantum-approximate-optimisation-algorithms-for-real-world-scenarios---Strangeworks](https://github.com/womanium-quantum/Quantum-approximate-optimisation-algorithms-for-real-world-scenarios---Strangeworks/blob/main/Intro.ipynb) maybe previous ibm quantum challenge top score as a direction for research a solution.
