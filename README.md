- [x] [Digital-analog Variational Quantum Eigensolver (IQM)](https://github.com/iqm-finland/iqm-academy-womanium-hackathon-DAQC-VQE)complete task to get full score.

experience: one of the worse hackathon ever, team member all dissapear with no response.

My own opinion:
hackathon its self, overall is worthless compare to other hackathon, but is a good place for finding jobs related to quantum, and understand different problem. 
I would definitly rather choose QHack, QCHack, iQuHack, because of the prize, swag, and everything is just better.
